! Ferromagnetic nickel example. A small global magnetic field is required to
! break spin symmetry. Check the total spin moment of the cell in the file
! INFO.OUT. Note that large k-point grids are required for obtaining accurate
! moments.

! This example generates the spin-polarised Wannier projector outputs for Ni 
! Wannier d states
